#Day 100: Portfolio


#Build a portfolio of Python projects to showcase your skills.

#This is the last day of the 100 days of code challenge. I have learned a lot and I am happy to have completed this challenge. 
# I will continue to learn and improve my skills. I will also continue to work on projects and build my portfolio. 

#For my portfolio, I will include projects that I've worked in during the 100 days of code challenge. 
#Here is the link to my github repository where I have uploaded all the projects:

#Would be happy to hear feedback on my projects.
